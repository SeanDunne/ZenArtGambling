### Puzzle outline (from article):
>I shuffle a regular deck of cards and put it facedown in front of you. You can make an even-money wager on whether the top card is black or red, betting any amount from zero up  >to the amount you currently have. Letâ€™s say you bet $10 that the card is red. I then turn the card over. Depending on whether you are right or wrong, $10 is either added to your >pot or taken away. Thus, if the card was black, you now have $90. If you then bet $20 dollars that the next card is black, and it is, you now have $110.
>The game continues until all the cards are turned over, or your pot shrinks to zero.  This means you have up to 52 chances to bet.
